function targetPosition = ChoosePlayerToPass(players, indexOfPlayer, markedDistance)
% This function chooses a player to pass to based on the distances between players and the availability of a pass.
% Inputs:
%   - players: a 3xN cell array where the first row contains the coordinates of the players, the second row contains the velocities of the players, and the third row contains the team affiliations of the players (0 for team A, 1 for team B).
%   - indexOfPlayer: the index of the player who has the ball.
%   - markedDistance: the maximum distance between the target player and the nearest opponent.
% Output:
%   - targetPosition: the coordinates of the player to pass the ball to.

% Depending on the team of the player with the ball, select the distances to team mates and opponents.
